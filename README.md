# DokiDokiBootcamp

A satirical visual novel videogame made entirely in Java.

This game was inspired by Code For All_'s

This was a game jam program done in under a week.
My Java knowledge at the time was only 3 weeks of classes, the code may not be the prettiest but I'm very proud of what I learned during the project.
